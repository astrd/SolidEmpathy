The main objectives of this application are the following:</0>",
    "libraryList": "<0><0><0> Improve user experience </0> for the moment, interacting with a POD is complex and difficult if you're not used to the computer science world. We're trying to make it easier to the users to manage the data they want to store in their POd, because the first step to gain users, is making their life easier.</0><1><0>Improve security and privacy</0> With the actual way to manage the POD, there are some critical security flaws, for example, granting access to a user so he can deny you access to your own POD, this should not be allowed.</1><1>Starting point to build a prototype of a search engine based on the SOLID platfrom/principles.</1></0>",

If not, please don’t misrepresent yourself by using the Solid logo.</0><1>Please don't use the inrupt name as a part of your company name, website name, domain name, service name, or app name. Don't use our logo as your own or modify it to fit into your own logo.</1><2>If you’d like, you may use the inrupt logo to indicate that your application is powered by inrupt’s SDK, but please make sure the context is clear to the user. Your own logo should always be larger than inrupt’s logo, for example.</2></0>",
